                    <p>     My interest in web development originates from my
                        appreciation for the internet. Growing up in the 90's,
                        I was able to witness the dot com boom in the "user" 
                        perspective. From the days of dial-up to wireless 
                        connection, user experience has grown increasingly more
                        interactive. 
                       
                            Impressed by the ever evolving user experience
                        and packed with a decades worth of user experience, I am at
                        the point where I intend to dig a bit deeper and expand my
                        understanding of this phenomena as a Full Stack Developer.
